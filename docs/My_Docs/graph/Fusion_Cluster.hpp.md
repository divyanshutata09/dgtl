## Vision
This component exists to make the compiler/runtime pipeline explicit, safe, and predictable under high-performance constraints.

## Why This File Exists
- Model execution structure and dependencies to enable region-level scheduling and fusion.
- Keep responsibilities localized so surrounding passes and backends can compose without hidden coupling.
- Preserve correctness with explicit guardrails before optimization gains.
- Region-level modeling here enables larger-than-instruction scheduling and fusion decisions.

## Core Logic
- Inputs are validated early and non-actionable states return fast.
- Main logic operates on typed IR structures and explicit state transitions.
- Traversal is iterative to keep performance linear over stream and region size.
- Dispatch logic uses explicit switching to keep opcode or policy behavior transparent.
- The design favors deterministic transformations and bounded side effects.

## Control Flow Graph and Map

## Control Flow Narrative
- Entry points validate stream and state before any mutation or expensive work.
- Processing is mainly loop-driven to walk nodes, regions, or dependency structures.
- Dispatch branches by opcode or strategy to keep behavior explicit and testable.

## Include Dependencies
- #include <vector>
- #include <algorithm>
- #include "Region.hpp"

## Class and Struct Catalog
### Classes
- class FusionCluster {

## Enum Catalog
- enum class FusionType {

## Function Catalog
- bool can_add_region(Region* region) const {
- void add_region(Region* region) {
- void apply_fusion() {
- double calculate_benefit() const {
- bool validate_fusion() const {

## Design Decisions and Whys
- Explicit typing across IR nodes and flags reduces hidden semantic drift.
- Guard checks prevent invalid states from propagating into emitters and runtime paths.
- Layered modules allow policy evolution in pass and pipeline without backend rewrites.

## Critical Invariants
- Public operations should preserve deterministic behavior for equivalent inputs.

## Practical Reading Order
- Start with type and enum declarations.
- Follow entry functions for control-flow intent.
- Then inspect helper methods for safety and transformation details.
